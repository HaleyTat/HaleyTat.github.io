<!--  --> 341 week-03-assignment README.md

This first assignment was a good refresher in this course. I worked with some HTML last semester in Michael Musick's 191 class, but I am very excited to continue working with web design and develop skills that will allow me to underdtand markup languages on another level, such as annotations and linking websites within my own.

My repository is where all of my 341 work will be stored for this class, and I can't wait to add to my portfolio of work in coding!!
