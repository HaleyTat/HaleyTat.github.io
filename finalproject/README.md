<!--  -->HW Final Project Blog Entry

 The final project demanded the most time I've spent coding. The whole process was aggressive, yet enjoyable. Creating separate .js files kept me organized. The flowers.js includes two moving objects which made it a little bit longer of a file. In order to keep the actions the same though throughout the random calls to the sequences of the array, they had to be included in the same nested "if" statements in order to keep them on the same motion. The text is the first that I've ever added to a project and I believe really brings the project resolution to the quick narrative. The most difficult times were spent trying to find errors in the "newMvmt" functions that add the movement for each class. After going back to correct inaccuracies, I am extremely happy with the result. All parts of the code are executing almost exactly how I desired them to.
