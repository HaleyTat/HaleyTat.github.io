-- cleaning up codes and using classes

  The first part of this assignment and assembling the class was really interesting in developing the syntax for it. Adding multiple .js files to the same sketch was easier to merge and the concept was the easiest to grasp during this assignment. The array is still a bit of a mystery to me since I wasn't able to understand the pop() method. However, I was able to use push() successfully, and was abel to use two classes to create my sketch. I was hoping to use color for a mousePressed function, but the sketch itself was already intricate enough and gave me a challenge with it itself. I'm happy with the result and the illusionistic quality it possesses, which was my intention from the beginning.
