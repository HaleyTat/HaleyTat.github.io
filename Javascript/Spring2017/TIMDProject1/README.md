<!--  --> TIMD Project 1
-- In this project design, I started by wanting to manipulate space through Processing to make people aware of the space around them. Because of unforeseen sub-problems/complications in working with this new application, I ultimately shifted over to p5 in carrying out a new idea.

    I wanted to work in manipulating forms resembling the human figure and construct these forms to be under the effects of gravity that I establish in the program by using a speed variable. Elements that I am interested in learning about through p5 in this project is depth, 3D form, and mass.
