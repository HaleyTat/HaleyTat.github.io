<!--  -->Final Project Proposal

  This final project, I want to zero in on my focus on animation and use this project to help further develop skills in learning technical animation. I want to to create in a separate file for this project, and code 2 classes, which will consist of collective simple lines that will create a simple drawing of a side profile. One in each, so that it will have 2 head side profiles. These two will be facing each other and through basic parameters within each class by changing XPOS and YPOS at those plotted points. I will shift only the mouth and eyebrows of these sketches during their interaction. The background color will be a signal of the interaction using symbolic meaning to convey the quality of the conversation. It will shift to either green or red throughout the short interaction. I will achieve the background color using a simple mapping function in the background that I will use the timeout function to execute the time of these specific colors of red and green to occur.

  The project was heavily inspired by the Digital Artist and Animator, Nicolas MÃ©nard. He focuses on people within space and the interactions within the environment he programs.


<!--  -->Still deciding if there should be audio, or even text to facilitate the dialogue and match its background color.

(This is an extra idea to make it interactive, not sure if I will use it.)
  Also, this sketch will be interactive in the mouseIsPressed function to interrupt the conversation and will cause a yellow background. Also, within this mouseIsPressed function, there will be the two classes or heads that will shift their faces towards the viewer. The viewer is included in this interaction, but it causes an interruption, which is why the background is yellow. This yellow will display caution to the viewer, letting them know they have interrupted the interaction. Text will be displayed when mouseIsPressed function is executed, saying something along the lines of "What do you want?". When the mouse is released, the conversation will commence.

Possible SUBPROBLEMS

The possible subproblems will be meticulously working out the timing of the timeout function with the animation of the two profiles. After linking the two files into the main sketch.js file, the rest of the subproblems I will most likely encounter will be the ability to make all of these separate functions to execute. This has been a big problem in the past with past assignments like Pacman, so this will be the biggest challenge.
